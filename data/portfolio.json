With how big of a game Stardew Valley is I wasn't able to finish or make art for it, however what I did make was most of the <span>core mechanics</span> such as; <br> <br> <strong> Player Inventory, Crafting, Building and Breaking, Simple Combat, Farming, Day-Night Cycle and more. </strong> <br> <br> I had counted over <span>4,000 lines</span> of <span>C# Code</span> at one point.",
